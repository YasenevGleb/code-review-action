At the moment a programmer starts an\n+assembly, he loses focus on a task and spends valuable working time. Different build systems use many tools,\n+helping to assemble a project faster, namely caching, task parallelization, distributed building and much more.\n+The subject of this article is caching, because completed tasks caching allows not to spend resources again. \n+So in [EO](https://github.com/objectionary/eo) caching is used for speeding up programs work.\n+While developing [EO](https://github.com/objectionary/eo) we found caching errors in `eo-maven-plugin`\n+for EO version `0.34.0`. The error occurred, because using a file name and comparing equality of\n+compilation time and caching time is not the most reliable verification. Unit tests were written showing that \n+cache does not work correctly. Also reading a file was necessary for getting a programme name \n+that slowed down an assembly. \n+That we came to conclusion that we need caching with a reliable verification which does not require reading a file\n+from disk. And using cache should save us enough time for building a project.\n+\n+The goal of this article is to research caching in frequently used build systems (`ccache`, `Maven`, `Gradle`)",
